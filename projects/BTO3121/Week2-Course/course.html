        <h3>1. The Departure</h3>
        <p>
          The train hissed like a tired dragon as it pulled out of the
          small-town station. I pressed my forehead against the glass, watching
          the familiar rooftops fade into mist. I wasn’t running away — not
          exactly. I was simply chasing something unnamed: the kind of silence
          that exists between foreign words, the kind of calm that comes when
          you’re lost but not afraid.

        <h3>2. The First City</h3>
        <p>
          I arrived in Lisboa, a city made of sun and music. The streets tilted
          and turned like the thoughts in my head — uncertain, but beautiful.
          Every corner smelled of coffee and sea salt, every wall hummed with
          the strum of a distant guitar. I learned quickly that travel isn’t
          about destinations; it’s about moments that arrive without warning: A
          child offering a flower at a tram stop. A stranger’s laughter echoing
          through a narrow alley. The quiet satisfaction of finding your way
          back without a map.

        <h3>3. Lessons from the Road</h3>
        <p>
          Days turned into weeks, and I carried less each day. By the third
          country, I had stopped buying souvenirs — the real treasures were the
          things I couldn’t pack: The sound of waves beneath a midnight ferry.
          The warmth of a shared meal when languages failed. The comfort of
          realizing the world is kinder than you feared. In Marrakesh, I lost my
          journal in a spice market. At first, I panicked — then I laughed.
          Maybe stories were meant to be scattered, like cumin dust in the wind
        </p>

        <h3>4. The Return</h3>
        <p>
          When I finally came home, the town hadn’t changed — but I had. My
          suitcase was half-empty, my heart half-full. Travel had taught me
          something profound: the world is a tapestry of experiences, each
          thread vibrant and unique. I returned with stories etched in my mind,
          a collection of moments that would never fade.

        <h3>Reflections for the Next Journey</h3>
        <p>
          If I could offer a few words to the next traveler, they would be
          these: Don’t rush to arrive — linger where time moves slowly. Talk to
          strangers — they hold entire worlds inside their stories. And always,
          always, leave a little space in your plans for the unexpected. Because
          sometimes, the most important paths are the ones that don’t exist on
          any map.
